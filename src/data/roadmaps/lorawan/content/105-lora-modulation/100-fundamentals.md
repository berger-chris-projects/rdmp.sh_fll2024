# Fundamentals

To learn about the LoRa and LoRawan, you need to understand the fundamentals of the LoRa modulation and the LoRaWAN protocol. This section will help you to understand the fundamentals of LoRa modulation and LoRaWAN protocol. Understanding fundamentals will help you to understand the LoRa and LoRaWAN in a better way and will help you understand the other sections of this roadmap such as Sigfox and NB-IoT.
