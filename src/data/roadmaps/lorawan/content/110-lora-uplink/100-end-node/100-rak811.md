# RAk 811 Breakout module

RAK811 LPWAN Breakout Module is a combination of the RAK811 chipset and the RAK811 Breakout Board. It is a barebone LoRa® Node solution which is a balance between small size and access to GPIOs via a header.

With Semtech SX1276 at its core, the RAK811 LPWAN Breakout Module takes advantage of all LoRa® features. Long-range, low power consumption is at its core.

The setup is easy and straightforward. The firmware fully supports the LoRaWAN® 1.0.2 stack. The node can work in a number of modes, with different data rates and read data from the attached sensors. This is all configurable via AT commands.
