# What is OSI Layer?

OSI layer is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard communication protocols. The model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers. The original version of the model had seven layers.

## OSI Model
### Layer 1: Physical Layer
### Layer 2: Data Link Layer
### Layer 3: Network Layer
### Layer 4: Transport Layer
### Layer 5: Session Layer
### Layer 6: Presentation Layer
### Layer 7: Application Layer
