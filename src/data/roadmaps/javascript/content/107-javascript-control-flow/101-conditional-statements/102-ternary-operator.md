# ternary operator

The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a `condition` followed by a `question mark (?)`, then an `expression to execute` if the condition is `truthy` followed by a `colon (:)`, and finally the `expression to execute` if the condition is `falsy`.

## Example

```js
condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse;
```
